# Bootstrap Grid Extension Generator

### Description
An application that generates css files that extend the core grid functionality of bootstrap. The vanilla grid system is restrictive with only 12 columns and four somewhat arbitrary view-port sizes. This application changes that by allowing the user to easily generate as many columns as they like, across user-defined viewport widths.

### Instructions
Enter the name you'd like for your new css file in the File Name field. Use the Column Properties table to adjust properties of all columns. Use the Column Types table to define new types of columns for different viewport widths. Enter the number of columns you would like to generate. Select the Minify box if you want the most compact file to be generated. Press the Generate button to generate your new file!
